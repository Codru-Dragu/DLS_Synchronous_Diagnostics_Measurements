This is the hardware portion of the project. It consits of the codes for a sender (Userside Arduino) and reciever (Midbox Arduino) as well as enclosures for the circuits required


STL for Trigger Enclosure Summary:
	
1 x UserSide_Box - the box for the control room arduino
	
1 x Midbox_Box - the box for the midbox arduino

1 x MidBox_Lid - lid for midbox box
	
1 x UserSide_Lid - lid fo userside box
	
1 x Userside_Cableholder - to secure the ethernet cable from the userside arduino box

4 x Midbox_Clip - Spacers to mount the midbox box. Print 2 extra (2+2) in case there are any drilling mishaps
	
1 x CamAdapt  - Adaptor for the Manta cam. Print for however many cameras there are. In our experiment, there was 1

2 x ActualTetAdapt - Adaptor for the Tetramm. Print for however many cameras there are. In our experiment, there waere 2
	
3 x Adapt_Lid - Lid for the TetrAMM and Camera Adaptor Boxes. Print for however many boxes there are. In our experiment, there were 3
