Created by Summer Student 2021, Codrutza Dragu, University of Oxford

The hardware and software elements of the trigger are in their respective foler. A PDF help guide to both is located in the main directory, with the order of the GUI execution and what each file does. A general overview of the project is as given below:

This project is centered around helping the Diagnostics team acquire better data during their beamline vibrations analysis. This is done through a two-fold system, consisting of a ‘button-press’ hardware element to synchronously trigger the diagnostics hardware on the beamline, and a software package to fix any issues during data acquisition, and provide a user-friendly analysis interface. The system was tested on the i18 beamline in late June, and approximately 7hours worth of synchronous data was acquired and analyzed. The graphs produced at the end of the experiment indicate possibly uncorrelated vibrations coming from the horizontal focusing mirrors closest to the sample.

An issue many beamlines face, and one that affects the quality of the data acquired on the beamline, is if there are significant unwanted vibration present during beam time. These vibrations could be internal and come from the optical elements along the beamline, or from elements in the ring. They could even be external and come from overhead motion or from the air conditioning system. Identifying the source of unwanted vibration is critical in maintaining the quality of the beamline and the stability of the beam. Use of the diagnostics hardware present on the beamline allows data to be taken at beamline positions, and compared to determine whether there is uncorrelated motion present between the different acquisition devices, and if so, then further identification of the component causing the vibration. To accurately determine non-correlated motion, data should be acquired synchronously across all the hardware. The current limitation is that the EPICS interface controlling the hardware allows only manual acquisition for each hardware, and has no way to coordinate grabbing data from multiple hardware at the same time. The scope of this project is to produce a physical trigger system to control the hardware, and a software package that allows the trigger experiment to be monitored and has post-experiment Fourier analysis capabilities. 

The User Manual is porvided as the 'Help Guide' file and provides intructions and information about both the hardware and software packages.
